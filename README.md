# MemoryGame 
This is a memory card game made with Vanilla Javascript and basic HTML & CSS.
Users are allowed to select two cards at a time. 
If the color of these cards match, the two cards stay face up and become transparent.
Otherwise, these cards turn over again. 
The game is over once all the pair of matched cards stay face up.
